SMH Editor [Clancy Yeates](https://www.smh.com.au/by/clancy-yeates-hveh2) reported that Gerard Minack considers [Coal companies](Google 'coal companies asx') will be “the tobacco stocks of the next 20 years”
- While some view fossil fuel producers as risky investments, Minack argues these companies will benefit as governments limit their competitors by preventing new fossil fuel developments. He draws a parallel with tobacco stocks, which he says have been a highly lucrative investment because governments outlawed their biggest expense: marketing and advertising.
